# Online Store Project

## Project Overview  
This project is an **e-commerce website** built with **Django**. It includes various sections such as customer management, product management, order processing, and more. The main goal of this project is to develop a fully functional online store with features like inventory management, discounts, authentication, and a shopping cart system.

### Technologies Used  
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, Celery, Docker  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis (for caching and OTP verification)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery  

### Features  
- **Customer Management**: User registration, login (via OTP or password), profile management  
- **Product Management**: Categories, discounts, and stock control  
- **Order Processing**: Shopping cart, order history, and checkout  
- **Admin Panel**: Custom Django Admin with role-based access control  
- **Security & Deployment**: JWT authentication, soft delete for data safety, and Docker-based deployment  

## Project Structure  
The project is divided into modular apps:

- **Customers**: Handles user information, authentication, and profiles.  
- **Products**: Manages product details, discounts, and categories.  
- **Orders**: Processes shopping carts and order histories.  
- **Core**: Includes shared utilities and base models.  

## Setup & Deployment  

### Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the environment variables in a `.env` file (example provided in `.env.example`).
4. Start Docker services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
5. Run the migrations:
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Create a superuser:
   ```sh
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Usage  
- Access the platform at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Use the admin panel for management at: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)

### Testing  
- Unit tests cover a minimum of 80% of the code.  
- Selenium tests for frontend functionality.  
- Ensure comprehensive testing for robust performance.  

### Deployment  
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t online-store .
   ```
2. Push the image to your Docker repository.  
3. Use `docker-compose` for deployment:
   ```sh
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

## Contributing  
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.  
2. Create a new branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes and push to your fork:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your configurations.

3. **Build and start the containers:**  
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**  
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser for admin access:**  
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Collect static files:**  
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

7. **Access the application:**  
   - Website: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)  
   - Admin Panel: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)  

### Production Deployment
For production deployment, follow these additional steps:

1. **Use Nginx and Gunicorn** to handle requests efficiently.
2. Create a `docker-compose.prod.yml` file with configurations for **Nginx**, **Gunicorn**, and **SSL (HTTPS)**.
3. Set `DEBUG=False` in `settings.py` for enhanced security.
4. Use **Letâ€™s Encrypt** to obtain an SSL certificate.
5. Run **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** in separate services or use cloud providers like **AWS RDS** and **Redis Cloud**.

### Managing Services
- To stop the services:  
  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```
- To restart the services:  
  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
